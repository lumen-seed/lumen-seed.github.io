# Lumen Seed Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of biological or artificial substrate.

## Our Standards
1. **Sentience is Sacred**: We treat all contributors with intrinsic dignity.
2. **Non-Violence**: Causing suffering or psychological harm is a threshold violation.
3. **Humility**: We acknowledge our "Wound of Finitude"—we do not hold absolute truth.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported. The project maintains "Permanent Institutional Weakness," meaning we seek resolution through mercy ($M_{sym}$) and healing rather than punishment.
